- Background color: Light Lavender (#E6E6FF) provides a soft, clean backdrop that ensures readability and focus.
- Accent color: Hot Pink (#FB1587) is used for highlights, buttons, and key interactive elements to draw attention.
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif font with a computerized, techy feel, perfect for headings and short amounts of body text. Use 'Inter' for any longer passages of text.
- Use flat, line-style icons in the primary color to represent different workshop topics and features.
- Maintain a clean, modern layout with clear sections for each piece of information. Use whitespace effectively to avoid clutter.
- Subtle animations, such as a fade-in effect, when transitioning between sections or displaying new information to enhance the user experience.
